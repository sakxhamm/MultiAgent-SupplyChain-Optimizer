# Multi-Agent Supply Chain Optimizer

A comprehensive multi-agent system framework designed for supply chain optimization and management. This project provides a robust platform for building intelligent agent-based solutions that can optimize various aspects of supply chain operations.

## Overview

This project implements a sophisticated multi-agent architecture that enables:

- **Intelligent Agent Communication**: Seamless interaction between multiple specialized agents
- **Supply Chain Optimization**: Advanced algorithms for optimizing supply chain workflows
- **Real-time Decision Making**: Dynamic agent coordination for real-time supply chain management
- **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design allowing easy integration of new agents and capabilities

## Features

- Multi-agent coordination and communication
- Python and .NET implementations
- Flexible agent configuration and management
- Real-time monitoring and analytics
- Extensible plugin architecture
- Comprehensive API for integration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
